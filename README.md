## Introduction to GRBs and their afterglows

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are short, intense flashes of gamma ray light (high-energy radiation). They can last anywhere between a few milliseconds to a couple of minutes to a few hours. The duration of a Gamma Ray Burst, also known as prompt emission, includes radiation peaks at these wavelengths. After a gamma ray burst occurs, a flash of light is created and an afterglow is displayed, ranging from X-ray to radio wavelengths. The duration of an afterglow can last anywhere between a few hours to a few weeks. To exemplify how powerful GRBs are, a single gamma ray photon is more powerful and energetic than a million visible photons combined. In conclusion, GRBs help improve our understanding of astrophysical processes as well as the evolution of galaxies.
